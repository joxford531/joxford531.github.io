      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm John. I'm a senior software engineer with particular expertise in 
        Data Platform, AWS, and DevOps Engineering. I've been building web applications,
        services, infrastructure, and delivering software projects since 2014. In that
        time, I've worked on, designed, and been the architect of over a dozen projects
        from traditional C# ASP.NET web apps to healthcare ETL solutions completely deployed
        using Infrastructure as Code (IaC). I'm most energized when I get to work with a
        well built team building applications that solve important
        problems, while ensuring the code we write is secure,
        scalable, easy to deploy, and easy to maintain.
      </p>

      <p>During my time, I have acquired and refined expertise in the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Javascript, Typescript, C#, Python, Elixir, and Node.js</li>
        <li>Building and using AWS infrastucture completely in CloudFormation, 
          AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK), Terraform, and deployed using AWS CodeBuild + CodeDeploy
          and Gitlab.
        </li>
        <li>Near real time monitoring of systems using AWS Kinesis with single second latency.</li>
        <li>
          Full-stack, cloud-based applications using Node.js, TypeScript, and
          serverless architectures with Lambda, API Gateway, EvenBridge, and other
          AWS services.
        </li>
        <li>Relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.</li>
        <li>DynamoDB using various indexing patterns and projections.</li>
        <li>Snowflake, particularly involving data syncronization from S3 and PostgreSQL
          as well as adminstration for access control.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lifecycle strategy, security, and Role Based Access Control of healthcare data
          for HIPAA compliance.
        </li>
        <li>Communication skills with internal teams that have technical expertise to
          stake-holders that desire high level overview with architecture diagrams to
          show their clients.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        What I care most about is helping mentor early-career software developers through 
        pair programming, community building, and friendship. Specifically, my experience 
        in successfully pivoting my career from working in a toxicology lab after studying Biology 
        to becoming a programmer was at times quite challenging. I had little experience
        in the field outside of a few Object Oriented programming courses I took in college.
        I am passionate about using my experience as a guide and life advice for those who
        enjoy solving problems and could use mentorship.
      </p>
