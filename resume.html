      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm John. I'm a senior software engineer with particular expertise in 
        Data Platform, AWS, and DevOps Engineering. I've been building web applications,
        services, infrastructure, and delivering software projects since 2014. In that
        time, I've worked on, designed, and been the architect of over a dozen projects. These
        ranged from traditional C# ASP.NET web apps, Node.js + Express.js + AngularJS projects,
        and healthcare ETL solutions completely deployed using Infrastructure as Code (IaC). 
        I'm most energized when I get to work with a well integrated team building applications 
        that solve important problems, while ensuring the code we write is secure,
        scalable, easy to deploy, and easy to maintain.
      </p>

      <p>During my time, I have acquired and refined expertise in the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, Python, Node.js, and Elixir</li>
        <li>Building and using AWS infrastucture completely in CloudFormation, 
          AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK), Terraform, and deployed using AWS CodeBuild + CodeDeploy
          and Gitlab.
        </li>
        <li>Near real time monitoring of systems using AWS Kinesis with single second latency.</li>
        <li>
          Full-stack, cloud-based applications using Node.js, TypeScript, and
          serverless architectures with Lambda, API Gateway, EvenBridge, and other
          AWS services.
        </li>
        <li>Relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.</li>
        <li>DynamoDB using various indexing patterns and projections.</li>
        <li>Snowflake, particularly involving data syncronization from S3 and PostgreSQL
          as well as adminstration of Role Based Access Control (RBAC).
        </li>
        <li>
          Lifecycle strategy, security, and RBAC of healthcare data for HIPAA compliance.
        </li>
        <li>Communication skills with internal teams that have technical expertise to
          stake-holders that desire high level overview with architecture diagrams to
          show their clients.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        What I care most about is helping mentor early-career software developers through 
        pair programming, community building, and friendship. Specifically, my experience 
        in successfully pivoting my career from working in a toxicology lab after studying Biology 
        to becoming a programmer was at times quite challenging. I had little experience
        in the field outside of a few Object Oriented programming courses I took in college.
        I am passionate about using my experience as a guide and life advice for those who
        enjoy solving problems and could use mentorship.
      </p>

      <h2>Career Highlights</h2>

      <p>
        Throughout my career I've had the chance to be an architect on large projects as well as
        a developer on existing critical applications.
      </p>
      <details>
        <summary>Highlights from my time at Phreesia</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I was an Architect for a new Data Lake repository on AWS using Kinesis to enable quick
            data delivery of millions of records per minute, S3 file storage, Glue schema registration,
            and PySpark ETL processing. Relevant AWS technologies included: S3 Batch Jobs, Lambda, Glue,
            Lake Formation, DynamoDB, EC2, and API Gateway. This data lake helped teams migrate away
            from storing over a decade of historical data that was preventing efficient reindexing
            of SQL Server databases.
          </li>
          <li>
            I built and oversaw a project to directly sync data from various PostgreSQL
            databases in AWS RDS to Snowflake using open source connectors and
            Snowflake's native App with a k8s EKS based deployment using ArgoCD and
            Helm charts.
          </li>
          <li>
            We migrated terrabytes of data in SQL Server from an on-prem data center to AWS
            using AWS Snowball.
          </li>
          <li>
            In order to work with various stake-holders, I wrote out lots and lots of documentation
            in Confluence and built numerous architectural diagrams that made communication with many
            different types of teams easy.
          </li>
          <li>
            I mentored junior engineers in helping write PySpark ETL jobs and to understand and use
            AWS services like Glue, S3, and Lake Formation. I also spent much time helping instruct
            how to use IaC and CI/CD tools like AWS CDK, Terraform, and Gitlab.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Highlights from my time as PowerSecure</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>
            PowerSecure's monitoring team tracked near real time backup generator systems
            at over 2000 sites. These sites included data centers and big box stores to mobile
            generator systems.
          </li>
          <li>
            I was co-architect on the monitoring PowerControl PC3 system that allowed the
            monitoring team to remotely manage backup systems located all over the country. 
            PC3 used AWS Kinesis to delivery tens of thousands of data points per
            hour from control systems at these sites and could schedule and start these backup
            systems for testing as well as <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_management">load management</a></b> during peak energy consumption periods.
          </li>
          <li>
            As a full-stack developer on the SaaS web app built on top of PC3, I worked in TypeScript,
            AngularJS, Node.js, and EC2 instances managed by an Application Load Balancer.
          </li>
          <li>
            All infrastructure was managed through CloudFormation templates and EC2 instances were
            deployed with custom AMIs to create immutable web servers that could autoscale, tear-down,
            and quickly redeploy in case of problems.

            I worked as a full-stack developer on a client's real time monitoring system
            built with AWS Kinesis, Lambda, RDS, and DynamoDB. This client's project was one of
            the most successful projects during my time at the company.
          </li>
          <li>I helped lead built out a separate real time monitoring system as a full-stack developer
            that collected solar panel data with the same architecture patterns of using Kinesis,
            Lambda, and RDS.
          </li>
