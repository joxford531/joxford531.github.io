        Hi, I'm John. I've been a software engineer since 2014. I specialize in DevOps Engineering,
        Data Platform Engineering, Backend Development in C# .NET and Python, and Cloud Architecture
        in AWS. In particular I've been writing Infrastructure as Code in CloudFormation, AWS CDK,
        and Terraform over the past 4 years. I also have CI/CD experience in AWS with CodeBuild 
        and CodeDeploy, as well as Terraform using Gitlab runners. I currently deploy all of my side
        projects' infrastructure in AWS using my own hosted Gitlab instance running on EC2. I am
        very passionate about all things related to Data and Infrastructure as Code 
        in the Cloud and ensuring all deployment processes are automated.
